We investigate the role of sebaceous glands in lesion and non-lesion skin of psoriasis and 
atopic dermatitis patients using spatial transcriptomics. <br>
SpatialDE, DGE analysis and Pathway enrichment analysis were used to investigate the differences in the sebaceous glands.
Our findings support the hypothesis that sebaceous glands are not bystanders in inf inflammatory skin diseases.
