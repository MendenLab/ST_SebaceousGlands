## Summary
Spatial transcriptomics of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis revealed that sebaceous glands consistently express lipid metabolism genes and the inflammation marker SAA1.
Atopic dermatitis showed lipid-focused changes, while psoriasis displayed stronger inflammatory signatures including keratinization, neutrophil degranulation, and antimicrobial pathways.
These results indicate sebaceous glands actively modulate inflammation in a disease-specific manner.


## Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of Sebaceous Glands
- **Data**  
  - 6 lesional vs. non-lesional skin samples from psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients (~26k transcriptomes; 212 spots annotated as sebaceous glands).

- **Pipeline**  
  - Manual annotation → SpatialDE (SVG detection) → DEG analysis → Pathway enrichment.

- **Non-Lesional Skin**  
  - SGs identified by 5,449 DEGs.  
  - Four spatial patterns significantly enriched (patterns 1, 7, 8, 9).  
  - Key pathways: lipid/fatty acid/steroid/cholesterol metabolism and energy (pattern 9); mitochondrial/citric acid cycle, transport, cell cycle (patterns 1 & 7).

- **Lesional Skin Insights**  
  - Both AD and PSO: High expression of lipid metabolism/transport genes (ALOX15B, APOC1, FABP7, FADS1/2, FASN, PPARG, RARRES1) + inflammation-related SAA1.  
  - AD-specific: ACAD8, FADS6, EBP, HSD3B1, CCL17 (lipid/Th2-inflammation related).  
  - PSO-specific: SERPINF1, FKBP5, IFIT1/3, DDX58, ACOT4, S1PR3 (inflammatory/lipid) + keratinization and antimicrobial gene programs.

- **Pathway Enrichment Highlights**  
  - AD SGs: Cholesterol, fatty acid, steroid metabolism.  
  - PSO SGs: Keratinization, antimicrobial peptides, neutrophil degranulation.  
  - PSO vs. AD: Increased interferon signaling, keratinization, antimicrobial responses.
