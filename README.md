### ABSTRACT
Sebaceous glands drive acne, however, their role in other inflammatory skin diseases remains unclear. 
To shed light on their potential contribution to disease development, we investigated the spatial transcriptome of 
sebaceous glands in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients across lesional and non-lesional human skin samples. 
Both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis sebaceous glands expressed genes encoding key proteins for lipid metabolism and 
transport such as ALOX15B, APOC1, FABP7, FADS1/2, FASN, PPARG, and RARRES1. Also, inflammation-related SAA1 was 
identified as a common spatially variable gene. In atopic dermatitis, genes mainly related to lipid metabolism (
e.g. ACAD8, FADS6, or EBP) as well as disease-specific genes, i.e., Th2 inflammation-related lipid-regulating HSD3B1 
were differentially expressed. On the contrary, in psoriasis, more inflammation-related spatially variable genes (
e.g. SERPINF1, FKBP5, IFIT1/3, DDX58) were identified. Other psoriasis-specific enriched pathways included lipid 
metabolism (e.g. ACOT4, S1PR3), keratinization (e.g. LCE5A, KRT5/7/16), neutrophil degranulation, and antimicrobial 
peptides (e.g. LTF, DEFB4A, S100A7-9). In conclusion, our results show that sebaceous glands contribute to skin 
homeostasis with a cell type-specific lipid metabolism, which is influenced by the inflammatory microenvironment. 
These findings further support that sebaceous glands are not bystanders in inflammatory skin diseases, but can actively 
and differentially modulate inflammation in a disease-specific manner.
